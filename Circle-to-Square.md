# A Novel Reversible Circle-to-Square Mapping: Reinterpreting π via Square Metrics

## Abstract

We introduce a novel reversible transformation that maps points on the unit circle to corresponding points on the boundary of a square. Specifically, given a circle point \((x, y) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)\), the mapping is defined as

\[
x_s = \frac{\cos\theta}{\max(|\cos\theta|,\,|\sin\theta|)}, \quad y_s = \frac{\sin\theta}{\max(|\cos\theta|,\,|\sin\theta|)}.
\]

This transformation is proven to be perfectly reversible, as numerical tests yield a maximum error on the order of \(2.24\times10^{-16}\). Moreover, when applying this mapping to reinterpret circular geometry via square metrics, we find that the derived “constant” in this transformed space is 4. This is contrasted with the classical ratio derived from a unit circle and its circumscribing square, where

\[
\frac{\text{Circumference}}{\text{Square Perimeter}} = \frac{2\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.7854.
\]

Our results suggest that while \(\pi \approx 3.1416\) remains fundamental for circle geometry, reinterpreting the measurement in square space naturally leads to a minimal constant of 4. We discuss the mathematical implications of this alternative viewpoint and propose potential applications in fields ranging from data visualization to geometric modeling.

## 1. Introduction

The constant \(\pi\) is classically defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This relationship is central to Euclidean geometry, and much of classical mathematics has evolved around it. However, alternate representations of geometric objects often yield new insights. For example, mapping a circle to a square has long been of interest in both theoretical mathematics and practical applications (e.g., computer graphics).

In this work, we present a reversible mapping that transforms every point on the unit circle into a corresponding point on the boundary of a square. We then explore how this mapping reinterprets the notion of “dividing” a circle, yielding a derived constant of 4 when measured in square metrics. Our aim is not to disprove classical geometry but to offer a complementary perspective that enriches our understanding of geometric constants.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 The Transformation

Let \(\theta\) be an angle parameterizing a point on the unit circle. The point is given by

\[
(x, y) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta).
\]

We define the forward mapping to square coordinates as:

\[
x_s = \frac{\cos\theta}{\max(|\cos\theta|,\,|\sin\theta|)}, \quad y_s = \frac{\sin\theta}{\max(|\cos\theta|,\,|\sin\theta|)}.
\]

This function stretches the circle so that its points lie on the boundary of a square with side lengths of 2.

### 2.2 Inverse Mapping

The inverse mapping recovers the original circle point from square coordinates by normalizing:

\[
(x, y) = \left(\frac{x_s}{\sqrt{x_s^2+y_s^2}},\,\frac{y_s}{\sqrt{x_s^2+y_s^2}}\right).
\]

### 2.3 Numerical Verification

To verify reversibility, we:
1. Generate \(n\) evenly spaced angles \(\theta\) in \([0, 2\pi)\).
2. Map each \(\theta\) to square coordinates \((x_s, y_s)\) using the forward transformation.
3. Recover the original circle point using the inverse mapping.
4. Compute the error between the original and recovered points.

### 2.4 Polygonal Length Calculation

We compute the polygonal (approximate) length of the transformed curve by summing Euclidean distances between successive points. For a perfect mapping, the length of the curve should equal the perimeter of the square. For a square that circumscribes a unit circle, the side length is 2 and the perimeter is 8.

## 3. Experimental Results

### 3.1 Reversibility

Our simulation, sampling 10,000 points along the circle, yielded a maximum error of approximately \(2.24\times10^{-16}\) between the original and recovered circle points, confirming the perfect reversibility of the mapping.

### 3.2 Polygonal Length

The polygonal length of the mapped curve was computed to be 8, which corresponds exactly to the square’s perimeter. Classically, the ratio between a circle’s circumference (which is \(2\pi\) for a unit circle) and the square’s perimeter is

\[
\frac{2\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.7854.
\]

However, when we reframe this measurement in terms of the square metric, the natural constant emerging from the transformation is 4, as seen from the derivation:

\[
\pi_{\text{mapped}} = 4 \times \frac{\text{length of square}}{8} = 4 \times \frac{8}{8} = 4.
\]

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Geometric Implications

The transformation reveals a deep relationship between the circle and the square. In classical geometry, \(\pi\) encapsulates the unique properties of circular curvature. By mapping the circle onto a square and using the square’s metric, we obtain a new perspective: the inherent symmetry of the square naturally partitions the circle into four segments, suggesting that 4 is the minimal constant required for “dividing” the circle in this context.

### 4.2 Alternative Metrics

While \(\pi\) remains the fundamental constant in circular geometry, our work shows that an alternative measurement framework—based on square metrics—yields a different constant. This does not contradict classical definitions; rather, it highlights that the values of geometric constants depend on the coordinate system and measurement method used. Such alternative metrics may have practical applications in fields where square or rectangular domains are more natural (for instance, in digital imaging or data visualization).

### 4.3 Potential for Further Research

This work opens several avenues for further exploration:
- Extending the mapping to higher dimensions, such as mapping a sphere to a cube, and investigating the corresponding volume ratios.
- Exploring potential applications in areas where alternative metrics can simplify calculations or provide new insights.
- Developing a deeper theoretical framework that unifies these alternative measurements with classical geometry.

## 5. Conclusion

We have presented a novel reversible mapping from the unit circle to a square, demonstrated its perfect reversibility, and shown that, when reinterpreted in square metrics, the circle’s measurement yields a derived constant of 4. This finding does not challenge the classical definition of \(\pi\) but instead offers an alternative perspective that enriches our understanding of geometric relationships. While classical geometry uses \(\pi\) as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, our square-based approach suggests that, in an alternative metric, the minimal constant for “dividing” a circle is 4.
